# Hidden Gems - Movie Recommendation System
By: **Cary Mosley** and **Bryan Santos**

***

This projects presents a recommendation system for movies. Our aim is to ensure that our recommendation engine is not biased towards popular movies. We want to be able to recommend **hidden gems** based on multiple criteria. Our goal is to build a hybrid model that will focus on content based recommendations when we do not have enough data for a user profile and weight our recommendations more towards similar users as we gather more data about our consumers. As ratings tend to be skewed towards popular movies we want to focus on movies that have high ratings but are not simply the most popular movies.
